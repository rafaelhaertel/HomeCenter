An app that controls your house

I developed this app due to the necessity of make my daughter Air Conditioner automatic, so that her bedroom can have a nice temperature every night. Later i've expanded the app to control the cable television reciever and some lamps. In a near future it'll control my entire house.

The app works with node using an api to control an raspberry pi.
